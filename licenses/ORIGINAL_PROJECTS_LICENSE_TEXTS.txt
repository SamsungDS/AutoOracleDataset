   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in Appendix A).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or when combined with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
   against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
   lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
   the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
   any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world (including the United States)
withhold copyright protection from names, titles, short phrases, and
familiar symbols or designs, numbering systems, or color combinations.

The Design Science License (DLS) was considered to be too complicated, and
so the Creative Commons License was developed. But, for works of authorship
that are dedicated to the public domain, no license is needed.

The persons who have associated work with this document (the "Work") to the
public domain dedicate any and all copyright and related or neighboring
rights they possess in the Work to the public domain.

You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial
purposes, all without asking permission.

A work released under CC0 may be protected by patent or trademark law;
this license does not apply to those areas.

Creative Commons may be contacted at creativecommons.org.

LICENSE: CC BY 4.0 International
===============================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the licensed material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them (e.g., file sharing via a peer-to-peer network).

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

  a. License Grant.
      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
          A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
          B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or later developed, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
      5. Downstream recipients.
          A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
          B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution according to Section 3(a)(1)(A).

  b. Other rights.
      1. Moral rights, such as the right to integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees to assert no such rights held against You, provided Your use is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or collective licensing scheme.
      4. In those jurisdictions where the Sui Generis Database Rights apply, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of Sui Generis Database Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or collective licensing scheme.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

  a. Attribution.
      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
          A. retain the following if supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
              i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
              ii. a copyright notice;
              iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
              iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
              v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
          B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
          C. include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

  b. ShareAlike.
     Not applicable. The Licensor has not elected to apply ShareAlike.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

For the avoidance of doubt, where Sui Generis Database Rights apply:
  a. the Licensed Rights include the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
  b. the Licensed Rights include the right to create and reproduce Adapted Material from the database;
  c. if You Share the database or Adapted Material from the database, You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a).

Section 5 – Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability.

  a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensed Material is provided "as is", without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and title. This disclaimer is for the benefit of the Licensor and applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.
  b. To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal basis (including, without limitation, negligence) for any loss or damage whatsoever, including direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, arising from Your use of the Licensed Material.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the duration of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
  b. Upon termination:
      1. for any reason, Your right to Share the Licensed Material ends immediately;
      2. any Adapted Material that You have not Shared prior to termination continues to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  c. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 survive termination of this Public License.
  d. Subjects to subsection (b), reversion of rights is automatic, and no further action by the Licensor is required.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
  b. This Public License shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where the Licensor is located, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law.
  c. If any provision of this Public License is held unenforceable, it shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
  d. The name "Creative Commons" is not a party to this Public License, and the organization has no obligation whatsoever with respect to the Licensed Material or this Public License. The name "Creative Commons" may not be used to assert or imply that Creative Commons endorses any use of the Licensed Material other than as expressly stated in Section 2(a)(6).
