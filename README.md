#AutoOracle_Dataset
This is the first dataset for C++ Test Assert Pair automatically generated by MUG.
The dataset is to train data sets for the LLM model, it is used the algorithm we developed by tree-sitter to extract the corresponding TAPs (Test Assert Pair) from the original C + + open source project: objective function, test function, and test prediction. Integrate these extracted data into a large data set. 
The data set is optimized and the oracle is formatted uniformly to improve the training ability of the model. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to provide it to the LLM, to help test functions generate test predictions automatically.

In the AutoOracle_Dataset:
1. data/AutoOracle_Dataset_train_1.json, data/AutoOracle_Dataset_train_2.json and data/AutoOracle_Dataset_test.json are the C++ training and testing datesets.
2. licenses/ORIGINAL_PROJECTS_LIST.txt:  this is the list of the open-source C++ projects downloaded from Github which we used to generate the dataset. It is including [project name + github url + license + copyright + notice files] info.
3. licenses/ORIGINAL_PROJECTS_LICENSE_TEXTS.txt:  this file is list up all the original license for the open-source C++ projects downloaded from Github which we used to generate the dataset.
4. licenses/notices/: under this folder there are the original notices files of the open-source C++ projects downloaded from Github which we used to generate the dataset.
